This file contains all of the components required to create a 2D image recognition
transformer (ViT) used for a binary classification problem.
ViT for ImageNet: https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01580
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9880094 

- ViT has a set of tokens + 1 class token. In this model, average pooling of the
model will be used instead of a class token
- Uses an average pooling layer at the end of all convolution layers. 
Generates a 1 dimensional string used for outputting classification of images
- Image transformers don't use a masked multi-head attention component,
as they don't need to be auto-regressive (look at both information from both the
past and the future of the current position in the input). This transformer is
bi-directional.


Possible hyperparams:
- How big the MLP depth is
- No. of attention heads
- Width of the network
- How many attention layers

This model is using the S/16 configuration from the ViT paper above.


Einops:
- Use to perform dot products on particular indices of passed tensors
using Einstein summation
- Use to transform from 1D to 2D, patchifying, etc.

"""
Creates the multi-head attention modules used within the ViT network.
The component of the network taking inputs will need N multi-head attention modules.
The component of the network taking outputs (also connected to the previous component)
will also need N multi-head attention modules.

Also includes the components for calculating the scaled dot product attention
from the input Keys, Queries, and Values.

Scaled Dot-Product Attention:
Q ->
    MatMul -> Scale -> Mask (optional) -> SoftMax -> Matmul ->
K ->                                                  ^

V -> Linear ->
K -> Linear -> Scaled Dot-Product Attention -> Concat -> Linear ->

A masked multi-head attention could be created by adding a mask layer to the 
scaled dot product attention component, but a mask layer will not be used for
this model.
