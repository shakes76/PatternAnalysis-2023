# Siamese network to classify Alzheimer's disease

## Task [7]

The model comprises a triple siamese convolutional neural network and a binary classifier. The model is trained to 
to classify 2D image slices of brain scans as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal cognitive (NC). The model aims to 
have an accuracy of 0.8 on the test set.
