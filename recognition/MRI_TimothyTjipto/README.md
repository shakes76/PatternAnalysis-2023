This project is about implementing a brain MRI super-resolution network (see Efficient Sub-Pixel CNN [7] and a Keras implementation) by training on the ADNI brain dataset (see Appendix for link). Create down-sampled data
(approximately by factor of 4) using either PyTorch or Tensorflow implementations. Network should
be trained to up-scale from 4x down-sampled input and produce a â€œreasonably clear image". [Normal
