## Task Statement
Problem 6: Classify Alzheimer's disease (normal or Alzheimer's Disease) of the ADNI brain dataset using a visual transformer. The goal is to achieve a 0.8 accuracy or higher on the test set.



 # Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of neurodegenerative disease affecting over 50 million people worldwide. However, most AD diagnosis occurs in the moderate to late stage, which means that the optimal time for treatment has already passed. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between cognitively normal people and AD patients. Therefore, the accurate prediction in the conversion process of MCI to AD may allow patients to start preventive intervention to slow the progression of the disease.

The accumulation of plaque and neurofibrillary tangles make several changes in brain structures. These changes could be used as a biomarker for the classification of MCI progression and are clearly analyzed by structural MRI (sMRI). Three planes of view are there in sMRI known as the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes

As part of this endeavour, we are tasked with developing a comprehensive open-source solution. This involves not only creating the model but also documenting the entire process, from data collection and preprocessing to model development and testing. Additionally, it would be required to collaborate with an existing open-source project by forking the repository and submitting your contributions through a pull request. The central objective of this project is to create a Visual Transformer model that excels in Alzheimer's disease detection.


The MRI scans dataset used for this project is a processed version of the original dataset that originates from the ADNI database. The ADNI was initiated in 2003 by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD to test whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological tests can be incorporated to measure the development of MCI and early AD.

# Dataset

The sMRI scans used for this study are collected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The data was preprocessed by the course staff so that most clinical information has been removed and only the images and labels remain. The dataset is divided in two portions, 

- Training set- consisting 21520 images
- Testing set- consisting 9000 images

The validation set is a subset of the training dataset.

# Description of Model

The Visual Transformer model employed in this project is designed for Alzheimer's disease detection from brain images. It leverages a patch-based approach, multi-head self-attention, and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for robust feature extraction. Data augmentation techniques enhance the model's generalization. Trained with an AdamW optimizer, it's evaluated using binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy. This model is optimized for the specific needs of Alzheimer's disease classification, making it a valuable tool for healthcare applications.

Transformers were designed to solve problems where non-local correlation is present, for example natural language processes, but have also been found to be very effective in image classification problems. Transformer models use multi-head self-attention to split the image into a series of patches (thereby maintaining some amount of positional information) and these patches are then processed by the encoder.


### Visual Transformers
ViT is an architecture for image classification that employs a Transformer-like architecture over patches of the image and can outperform common CNN architectures when trained on large amounts of image data. The concept of vision transformers is described as follows:

# Model Training

The dataset preprocessing involved:

- Image Resizing: All images are resized to a consistent dimension of 128x128 pixels.

- Data Augmentation: Training data is augmented with operations like horizontal flipping, rotation, and zoom to enhance data diversity.

- Labeling: Images are labeled as either Alzheimer's disease (1) or normal control (0).

- Data Splitting: The training data is split into training and validation sets to monitor model performance during training.

- Data Normalization: Image pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0 for improved training stability.


### Training Loop
The training loop iterates for a specified number of epochs, typically 80 in this case. The training data, which includes images and labels, is used to update the model's weights. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy as the evaluation metric.


### Validation
The model's performance is assessed during training using a validation dataset, which is separate from the training data. This allows for monitoring how well the model generalizes to unseen data.




## Testing of Model

The model predicts the class labels for the test dataset. The predictions are then compared to the ground truth labels to calculate various evaluation metrics. The primary evaluation metrics used in this project include:

- Accuracy: Measures the overall proportion of correctly classified samples.
- Loss: Represents the model's error in predicting the labels.
- Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Metrics that assess the model's performance in classifying Alzheimer's disease and normal control cases.

## Results

Testing accuracy was 67.2% which was below the accuracy which both the training and validation datasets achieved. This is partially due to the fact that the training set had around 20000 images, which is quite small when training a visual transformer. Also, the number of different images in training dataset were just over 1000 as each brain scan was sliced and distributed 20 times. Also, this can be due to the reduction factor being too high or the patience too low.
This code can be re-run in Rangpur server with an even large number of epochs to possibly increase its accuracy.
 



## Changes to Accomodate Feedback- 

Updated the hyperparameters in the the training model to increase the overall accuracy of the model. Increased the number of epochs fom 80 to 120. Decreased the learning rate for smoother convergence. Decreased batch size from 140 to 70 for potentially better convergence. Decreased weight decay for less regularization. This resulted in an increase in overall increase in accuracy from 67.2 to 74.4%. 

To accomodate the patient level split `dataset.py` will be updated to include patient information along with the image data. Creatae a `patient_id` = `extract_patient_id(filename)` function in dataset.py to extract and associate a patient id label with the images. The `modules.py` and `predict.py` files may be updated to accomodate the `extract_patient_id` function.
