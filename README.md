# Pattern Analysis
Pattern Analysis of various datasets by COMP3710 students at the University of Queensland.

We create pattern recognition and image processing library for Tensorflow (TF), PyTorch or JAX.

This library is created and maintained by The University of Queensland [COMP3710](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=comp3710) students.

The library includes the following implemented in Tensorflow:
* fractals 
* recognition problems

In the recognition folder, you will find many recognition problems solved including:
* OASIS brain segmentation
* Classification
etc.
